# * Variable names
# Be descriptive with naming variables so its easier to understand the code
# variables use _ & are all in lowercase
# students_count = 1000  # Integer
# rating = 4.99  # Float
# is_published = True  # Boolean
# course_name = "codeWithMosh"  # String

# * Strings
# course = "Python Programmming"
# print(len(course))
# print(course[0])
# print(course[-1])
# print(course[0:3])
# print(course[0:])
# print(course[:3])
# print(course[:])

# * Escape Sequences
# if you want to add another " into a string, you need a backslash
# course = "Python \"Programmming"
# print(course)
# Other Escape sequences
# \" Escapes "
# \' Escapes '
# \\ Escapes \
# \n Creates a new line
